Feature: General policy for all catalogs
  In order to ensure applicability of a host's catalog
  As a manifest developer
  I want all catalogs to obey some general rules

  Scenario Outline: Compile and verify catalog   # features/catalog/policy.feature:6
    Given a node named "<hostname>"              # features/steps/puppet.rb:50
    When I compile the catalog                   # features/steps/puppet.rb:62
    Then compilation should succeed              # cucumber-puppet-0.3.7/lib/cucumber-puppet/steps.rb:48
    And all resource dependencies should resolve # cucumber-puppet-0.3.7/lib/cucumber-puppet/steps.rb:28

    Examples: 
      | hostname |
      | percona1 |

Feature: Percona repositories
  In order to have a system that can install Percona packages
  As a sysadmin
  I want Percona repository to be available

  Scenario Outline: Check if percona repository is installed # modules/percona/features/catalog/policy.feature:6
    Given a node named "<hostname>"                          # features/steps/puppet.rb:50
    When I compile the catalog                               # features/steps/puppet.rb:62
    Then compilation should succeed                          # cucumber-puppet-0.3.7/lib/cucumber-puppet/steps.rb:48
    Then there should be a yum repository "percona"          # modules/percona/features/steps/repo.rb:1
    And all resource dependencies should resolve             # cucumber-puppet-0.3.7/lib/cucumber-puppet/steps.rb:28

    Examples: 
      | hostname |
      | percona1 |

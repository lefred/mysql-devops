This Vagrant setup can be used to test Percona Replication Manager for Corosync/Pacemaker

This is used with Centos 6 x86_64, and use a second nic for the galera replication.
That base box can be retrieved on http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11697684/centos6.box.bz2


How to use ?

vagrant up percona1
vagrant up percona2
vagrant up percona3

And this is all, you have now a cluster of 3 nodes. 


Note: SElinux is disabled, there is a selinux policy file included that allows the server to start but the other nodes aren't yet able to sync, I need to investigate...
